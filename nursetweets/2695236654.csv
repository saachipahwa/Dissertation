I just realised something.

Last night I had dreams. 

Not nightmares.

Not unsettling intrusions relating to suicide.

Not a darkness. That I struggle to wake up from and carry round all day.

Just random, pleasant dreams ‚ù§‚òÇÔ∏è

I can't even look at some of those clothes and gave most of them away before I left the ward.

Perhaps this is unique to me.
Or a shared experience; felt by many who have had lengthy hospital admissions #mentalhealth or otherwise...
But I wish I was prepared for how unsettling it is to see reminders; have to sort food that expired whilst on the ward. https://t.co/2ZiSX9GkKB"
