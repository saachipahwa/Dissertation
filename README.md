# Repository for MEng dissertation project entitled "Computational linguistic approach to quantify the impact of COVID on the well-being of different worker categories"

This repository contains Python files used in the computational method I developed that uses Twitter data to learn about the wellbeing of specific professions at different points during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The directories correspond to different steps within the method:
1. Data collection and cleansing functions are in the "data_functions" directory
2. Topic modelling functions are in the "topics_functions" directory
3. Graphing functions are in the "graph_functions" directory
4. Sentiment analysis and graphing functions are in the "sentiment_functions" directory

The actual user and twitter data is not included for ethical reasons but the file structure has been preserved to make the repository easy to understand. Each data file is empty but maintains its column names for the same reason. These empty data files are in the directories "data", "topics", "graphs" and "sentiment".

The "plots" directory contains the final graphs used in my analysis.
