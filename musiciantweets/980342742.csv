This is a gentler one, has an orchestral feel - would sound fab live with a big orchestra.

As the song is at the end of the album I feel like it leaves me wanting MORE.

This one didn't quite hit the spot on first play but maybe it'll be a grower."

BOP ALERT. This sounds like it was recorded in the 70s but I couldn't be sure - would have to find out.

The chorus is a VERY catchy one. Verses are less so, but if I listen to them enough I'm sure they'll stick.

overall - LOVE this one."

Probably the weakest one on the album so far - but it might grow on me. The opening reminded me of their song 'Fernando'.

It's a slow tempo one, not massively for me!"

Who is Dan and why are we keeping an eye on them? 

First impressions - giving me pure futuristic vibes, almost like a Voulez Vous sound. You could definitely dance to this.

ALSO that last bit - LOVELY bit of sampling from S.O.S. Did you spot it?"

Recorded in the 70s, this was meant to be released during ABBA's hay day back in the day. So it feels like a musical time warp.

This a typical ABBA sound. It ends a bit bluntly with a fade out but I guess that's how most songs ended in the 70s."

The first lyric very cleverly leads on from the end of the last track, with another reference to children playing in a park. CLEVER.

This is an all round bop, feels like it was written about ABBA's comeback and the reaction they were hoping to get."

This is a Christmas song. It has a warm feeling to it, really quite christmassy with references to children playing with new toys and warm christmassy feels.

Never thought I'd ever hear a Christmas song by ABBA. Maybe I'll listen to it all year round?!"

At the start of this song I was like HMM not sure. By the end of it I was picturing myself dancing to it on that ABBA Voyage dancefloor. Seeing as ABBA are Swedish, it comes as no surprise that it has a very ‚ú®Swedish‚ú® feel. I like it a lot."
